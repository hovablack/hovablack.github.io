My first introduction to computing and early programming was through my father. He is a self-taught programmer; he designed and built a software that taught us math in a fun way. The math program drew my interest to computers which always seemed like it was meant solely for work. My early years were spent mostly on the Nintendo Entertainment System (*NES*). I realized the element of fun in computers. I made the switch and started playing games on the computer. In those early days of MS-DOS, using command line interface gave the feeling of a programmer. 

I was given a choice at age fourteen to either get a new game console or a computer. I choose computer and never looked backed since. That was the defining moment for me. I knew there was much more I could do with a computer. Afterwards, I built my first computer with my father and then I was really hooked. Unfortunately, I declined when my father offered to teach me BASIC and C++. At that age it was only the gaming possibilities on computers and hardware building that interested me. I always regretted that decision.

It was not until I decided to try to use Linux (*Ubuntu*) that I realized the great opportunity in programming I had missed. The determination to continue with learning Linux felt like I had a second chance at programming. This made me seize the opportunity to learn Software Engineering at Flatiron School.
